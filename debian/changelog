hping3 (3.a2.ds1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer.
  * Repackaged as 3.a2.ds1 to remove non-free RFC texts.
  * debian/control:
    + Build-Depend on libpcap0.8-dev, dpatch (>= 2.0.9).
    + Change priority to extra.
    + Slightly reword long description.
    + Update maintainer contact info.
  * debian/copyright: Update maintainer contact info.
  * debian/rules:
    + Fix dpatch integration.
    + Ship hping3 TCL scripts as examples (and forcibly leave them
      uncompressed).
    + Various cleanups.
  * debian/patches/10_install.dpatch: New patch based on previous
    "Makefilein.dpatch".
  * debian/patches/20_libpcap0.8.dpatch: New patch for libpcap0.8
    compilation.
  * debian/patches/30_bytesex.dpatch: New patch stolen from my hping2
    package to make bytesex.h use endian.h instead of hardcoding byte
    orders; many thanks to Peter De Schrijver who provided a similar patch
    (closes: #283038).
  * debian/patches/40_spelling.dpatch: New patch stolen from my hping2
    package to fix various spelling errors in hping.
  * debian/patches/50_personality.dpatch: New patch, change all
    occurrences of "hping2" to "hping3" in help messages and in the man
    page.  Also say "hping3" instead of "hping" since the latter is really
    hping2 in Debian.
  * debian/patches/60_version.dpatch: New patch, this is really version
    alpha-2 so fix release.h accordingly.
  * debian/patches/00list: New file.
